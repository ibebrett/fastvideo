# FastVideo
A set of tools to quickly perform video tasks

fv_screenshot - Searches through the video for a "nice" screenshot as close to the end as possible.

fv_search - Compares a video to a list of noisy screenshots to determine the likelihood that those screenshots came from that video file.

# Dependencies

You need ffmpeg, CImg, and X11. To do conversions to useful formats it is preferable to have imagemagick installed (CImg will use it).
